# Mock Outdoor Clothing Website

This website is made to simulate an outdoor clothing store that a user can browse through. This website is equipped with functionality for both a customer and a manager. 

# Customer Experience:
A customer can toggle through several categories of items at this store(ie. jackets, gloves, etc), see different versions of them(ie. different colors, textures, etc), and their price

# Manager Expierence:
In addition to having the same functionalities as a customer, a manager can also create a custom shipping label based on an individual's shipping information, delete different items(using MySQL queries), and log in/log out of the system based on their credentials. 


# Installation
- To run this project, be sure to download Xampp. This will give you a preassigned folder in your C drive. 
- Toggle to the `htdocs` section, create a new folder with your name, and place your project in there.
- On your xampp application, start Apache and MySQL to turn on those connections.
- Finally, go to "localhost/(whatever your new folder name is)" to access the website.
  - As a side note, when trying to log in as a manager, it will only work based on usernames and passwords already written in the database. If you would like to use an already existing username and password, feel free to upload the database(I used phpMyAdmin to administer my database, but any other software should work). Otherwise(because this is supposed to simulate an actual manager who can only be inputted into the system on the backend, not directly through the website), follow the format in `add_accounts.php` to add additional fictitious managers.
